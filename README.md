# EAMENA-MachineLearning-ACD
The EAMENA machine learning automated change detection (EAMENA MLACD) is a tool developed by EAMENA researchers to rapidly monitor the changes at and around archaeological sites using satellite images.
The tool uses the cloud computing service Google Earth Engine (https://earthengine.google.com/). It was developed using JavaScript and machine learning algorithms (i.e. Random Forest) to process a time series of satellite images and create land classifications maps to detect the changes and threats in archaeological sites over time (Figure 1).
